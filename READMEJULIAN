To break this CypherText, I extended my earlier program to include the 
code given to decode this kind of cypher text.
A With a few new functions to inject hex values and correctly print them
I was able to loop though 0 -> 255 and print all "decoded" values.
Even though it was clear that it'd be much faster to go though these results
I still didn't want to read 256 lines of junk. 
A quick search for "the" brought me straight to the correct line.
